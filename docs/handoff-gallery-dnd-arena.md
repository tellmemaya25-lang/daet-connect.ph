# Prompt for Arena: gallery drag-to-reorder, upload loading tiles, better layout

Copy everything below to Arena.

You're working on CONNECT-Daet (`tellmemaya25-lang/daet-connect.ph`). It's a Next.js 16
App Router app with Tailwind v4 and Supabase. Read `AGENTS.md` and the relevant guide in
`node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing code.

### Where you're starting from

Your branch **`arena/2f2dab27-daet-connect-ph`** already has a first version of this work:
- `9b8060f` fixes package image uploads;
- `8392d0e` adds drag-and-drop and gallery reordering;
- `d8281f2` uploads a batch of photos at once;
- `91ad18c` puts a spinner inside the upload button.

**Build on that branch**, or on `main` if it has been merged by then. Don't start over.

The relevant files are in `src/app/(subsystems)/tours/operator/packages/[id]/edit/`:
- `GalleryStep.tsx`: the gallery section of the operator's Edit Package page;
- `use-sortable-list.ts`: drag to reorder, using native HTML5 drag events;
- `use-file-drop.ts`: dropping files from the computer to upload them;
- `edit-order.ts`: `moveItem` / `withDisplayOrder`, which keep positions 1..n;
- `actions.ts` (`uploadPackageImage`) and `permissions.ts`;
- tests: `use-sortable-list.test.tsx`, `use-file-drop.test.tsx`, `edit-order.test.ts`, `image-actions.test.ts`.

### What the owner sees today (from their screenshot of `/tours/operator/packages/[id]/edit`)

- A 4-column grid of 8 photo cards. Each card has a number badge, "No caption", ↑ ↓
  and "Caption" buttons, and a full-width red "Delete" button. That's four controls
  under every photo, which is heavy and repetitive.
- A blue "+ Add Image" button top right, and the hint "Drag photos here to upload them,
  or drag a photo onto another to reorder."
- A box with formats, size and the count limit, and a yellow warning that adding,
  removing or reordering photos on a published package sends it back for review.

### The three things the owner wants

#### 1. Drag a photo to rearrange, with the photos moving as you drag

The current hook uses native HTML5 drag-and-drop. It doesn't work on phones or tablets,
gives no live preview (you drop onto a card and the order jumps), and can't be used from
the keyboard.

Replace the reordering with a proper sortable grid:
- **Library:** use `@dnd-kit/core` + `@dnd-kit/sortable` + `@dnd-kit/utilities`.
  - Install exact versions that are at least two weeks old, and commit the lockfile.
  - It handles mouse, touch and keyboard, and has screen-reader announcements.
  - If you'd rather not add a dependency, build it on Pointer Events instead, but it
    must give the same behaviour.
- **While dragging:**
  - the picked-up photo follows the pointer, slightly lifted (a small scale and a ring,
    no resting shadows per the design rules), using a `DragOverlay`;
  - the other photos **slide aside live** to show where it will land
    (`rectSortingStrategy`), and the empty slot shows a dashed outline;
  - number badges update to the new order on drop.
- **Sensors:**
  - `PointerSensor` with a small activation distance (about 6 px), so clicks and caption
    edits don't start a drag;
  - `TouchSensor` with about a 200 ms press-and-hold, so scrolling the page on a phone
    still works;
  - `KeyboardSensor` with `sortableKeyboardCoordinates`.
- **Drag handle:** a grip icon button on each card, `aria-label="Move photo n"`. Allow
  dragging the whole photo with a mouse too.
- **Keyboard and screen readers:**
  - Space picks a photo up, arrow keys move it, Space drops, Esc cancels.
  - Provide plain-language announcements, e.g. "Photo 3 moved to position 1."
  - Keep "Move earlier" / "Move later" in each card's menu (section 3) as a fallback.
- **Saving:** keep using `moveItem` + `withDisplayOrder` from `edit-order.ts`, so
  positions stay 1..n and the existing save path and database guard keep working.
- **Status rules:** respect `permissions.gallery.reorder` and the existing rules for
  published packages. A reorder on a published package still sends it back for review,
  so the warning (section 3) must be visible before the person drags.
- **Uploads from the computer:** keep `use-file-drop.ts`. A drag that carries files is an
  upload, never a reorder. Make sure dnd-kit and the file drop don't fight each other.
- **Reduced motion:** with `prefers-reduced-motion`, no slide animations; items simply
  swap places.
- **Remove what's left over:** delete `use-sortable-list.ts` and its test, or keep the
  test's behaviour covered by new tests. Don't leave dead code. Never skip a test.

#### 2. A loading indicator in the gallery while photos upload

The button spinner exists. Now show the upload **where the photo will appear**:
- **Placeholder tiles:** as soon as files are picked or dropped, add one tile per file
  at the end of the grid.
  - Show a local preview with `URL.createObjectURL`, dimmed, with a spinner and
    "Uploading…" over it. Revoke the object URLs afterwards.
  - Don't invent a percentage: the server action gives no progress events. Show
    "2 of 5" at the batch level only.
- **On success:** the tile becomes the real photo card in place, with no layout jump.
- **On failure:** the tile shows the error message from the action, with "Try again"
  and "Remove" buttons.
- **While uploading:**
  - the button keeps its spinner and is disabled;
  - placeholder tiles can't be dragged;
  - the counter counts them toward the 20-photo limit.
- **Accessibility:**
  - an `aria-live="polite"` region announces "Uploading 2 of 5" and then "5 photos added";
  - spinners use `motion-reduce:animate-none`.

#### 3. A better layout (proposal; build it after a quick OK from the owner)

- **Header row:**
  - "Gallery" on the left, with the count "8 of 20 photos" and a one-line hint: "Drag to
    reorder. The first photo is shown first on the package page."
  - The Add button on the right, labelled "Add photos" (it accepts several files).
  - Move formats, size and the limit into one short line of help text under the grid,
    instead of a separate box.
- **Review warning:**
  - On published packages, show it at the **top** of the section, so it's read before
    anyone drags or deletes.
  - After an add, remove or reorder, change it to a short "Unsaved changes: saving sends
    this package back for review" notice.
- **First photo as the lead:**
  - At `lg` and up, photo 1 is a large tile spanning 2×2 with a "First photo" label, and
    the rest flow around it.
  - Grid: `grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4`, square tiles (`aspect-square`,
    `object-cover`), `gap-3`.
- **Cleaner cards:** the photo fills the card.
  - Top-left: the number badge. Top-right: the drag grip and a "⋯" menu button.
  - Caption on the photo's lower edge over a dark gradient. If empty, show "Add caption"
    as a subtle button, and edit it inline in place.
  - The "⋯" menu holds: Edit caption, Move earlier, Move later, Make first photo, and
    Delete (in red, last).
  - That replaces the four buttons under every card. On touch devices the grip and menu
    are always visible; on desktop they're visible at reduced opacity and fully on
    hover/focus, never hidden from keyboard users.
- **Delete with undo:** remove the card right away and show "Photo removed · Undo" for
  about 5 seconds. Nothing is saved until the form is saved, so undo just restores local
  state. Use this instead of a confirm dialog.
- **An "Add photos" tile at the end of the grid:** dashed border, plus icon, "Add photos
  or drop them here". It's also the file drop target, and it's hidden at 20 photos. The
  whole section still accepts dropped files, with a clear highlight while files are
  dragged over.
- **Empty state:** one large dashed drop area with "Add photos" and the help line.
- **Design rules:**
  - Follow `src/components/ui/design-rules.test.ts`: no resting shadows, no
    eyebrow/uppercase-tracking labels, `rounded-2xl`, no `bg-white` except exempt lines.
  - Support light and dark themes and phone width (375 px) with no horizontal scroll.

### Ground rules

- **Plan first.** Send the owner a short plan, including the layout proposal, and wait
  for their OK before coding.
- Stay on your branch. **No pull request** unless the owner says "make PR".
- No database changes are needed for this. If you find you need one, stop and ask:
  migrations go to production only with the owner's explicit yes.
- Never print or commit secrets. Don't invent photos, captions or facts.
- End every commit message with:

### Tests

- **Unit (Jest + Testing Library):**
  - keyboard reordering moves items and renumbers them 1..n;
  - a drag carrying files doesn't reorder;
  - reordering is disabled when `permissions.gallery.reorder` is false;
  - placeholder tiles appear per file and turn into cards or error tiles;
  - undo restores a deleted photo;
  - the counter includes uploading tiles.
- **Keep passing:** `edit-order.test.ts`, `use-file-drop.test.tsx`,
  `image-actions.test.ts`, `design-rules.test.ts`.
- **e2e (Playwright, 375 px and 1280 px, with axe):**
  - on a draft package in the mock (`e2e/mock-supabase.cjs`), reorder with the keyboard
    and with a mouse drag (`page.mouse` down, move in steps, up);
  - upload two files and see the loading tiles, then the cards;
  - no axe violations.
- **Commands:**
  - `npx tsc --noEmit`
  - `npm test`
  - `rm -rf .next && NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://example.supabase.co NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=dummy npm run build`
  - `npm run test:e2e`

### Done means

- Photos can be rearranged by dragging with a mouse, by press-and-hold drag on a phone,
  and with the keyboard. The other photos slide aside live, and the new order saves.
- Each uploading photo shows as a tile with its preview and a spinner where it will
  land, and failures can be retried.
- The new card layout is in place, after the owner's OK.
- Screenshots at 375 and 1280 px, in light and dark, are sent to the owner. All checks
  pass.
