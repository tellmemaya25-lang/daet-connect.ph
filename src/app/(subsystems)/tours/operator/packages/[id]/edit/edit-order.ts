/**
 * List positions in the package editor are 1-based and must be exactly
 * sequential — the server rejects anything else ("Image order must be
 * sequential (1, 2, 3...)"). The UI used to hand out array indexes (0-based)
 * for new items and after reorders, and left gaps when an item was deleted,
 * which made every save fail once a list had been edited.
 *
 * Every list mutation runs through these helpers, so the invariant holds by
 * construction instead of by care.
